# Django-Web-App Overview

This web app is a recreation of the New York Times, Wordle game. It is a basic JavaScript game where the player tries to guess a 5 letter word. The app is built on a Django framework and is started locally by running the following command in the project directory:

```
python manage.py runserver
```

This starts a server which can be accessed through a browser at localhost/8000.

The purpose of creating this app was to further my understanding of web development. I had some experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but had never built an ap using an eternal framework. As I have experience in python, Django seemed a good place to start.

# Web Pages

The project has three main webpages

    -Home/game
    -about
    -lost page

The homepage is where the main game is and is the most important page of the project. The about page is a basic page which describes the project. And lastly the lost, or "oops", page is where you are sent if the link address is incorrect. The lost page is less practical an more a joke that I decided to include in the project.

# Development Environment

I wrote the project in VS Code using HTML, CSS, JS, and Django Python.
