      The purpose of creating this app was to further my understanding of web
      development. I had some experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but had
      never built an ap using an eternal framework. As I have experience in
      python, Django seemed a good place to start.

      This web application is a recreation of the popular online game
      <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html">Wordle</a>
      by the New York times. The object of the game is to guess a five letter
      word in six guesses or less. After each guess the game will prompt the
      player with hints.
      <br />
      <br />
      A <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold"> green</span> square means
      that the letter is in the right place.
      <span style="color: yellow; font-weight: bold"> Yellow</span>
      indicates that the letter is in the word, but in the wrong place. If a
      square is <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold"> red</span>, the
      letter isn't anywhere in the word.
