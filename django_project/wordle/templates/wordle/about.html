      This project served both as a way to learn JavaScript and as an
      exploration in web development as a whole. I am still new as a programmer
      and am unsure of what I would like to specialize in. I have taken a simple
      HTML/CSS class which I enjoyed and I wanted to delve a little deeper into
      the front end side of computer science.

      This web application is a recreation of the popular online game
      <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html">Wordle</a>
      by the New York times. The object of the game is to guess a five letter
      word in six guesses or less. After each guess the game will prompt the
      player with hints.
      <br />
      <br />
      A <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold"> green</span> square means
      that the letter is in the right place.
      <span style="color: yellow; font-weight: bold"> Yellow</span>
      indicates that the letter is in the word, but in the wrong place. If a
      square is <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold"> red</span>, the
      letter isn't anywhere in the word.
